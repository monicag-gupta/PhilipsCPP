1. Write a C++ program using std::vector that performs the following:
Input n integers from the user and store them in a vector.
Display the vector elements.
Insert a new element at a specific position.
Delete an element by value.
Search for an element and display its index if found.
Sort the vector in ascending order.
Display the final vector.



2. Write a menu-driven C++ program using std::deque, which allows you to interactively perform all major deque operations through a looped menu system:
Insert at Front
Insert at Back
Delete from Front
Delete from Back
Display Front and Back
Display All Elements
Sort Deque
Exit



3. Use std::list<std::string> for creating a list of names. To do:
Add names to a list
Display all names
Remove a name
Sort names
Reverse names
Exit





4. Write a program that:
Takes input for n students, where each student has a roll number (int) and name (string).
Stores each student as a std::pair<int, std::string> in a vector.
Displays the list of students.
Sorts the list by roll number in ascending order.
Searches for a student by roll number and displays the name if found.




5. “Unique-Word Analyzer” : Write a C++ program that
Accepts two multi-line paragraphs from the user.
Tokenises each paragraph into words (ignore punctuation; treat upper/lower case as the same word).
Stores the words of each paragraph in separate std::set<std::string> objects.
Outputs
the words that appear in both paragraphs (intersection),
the words that appear in either paragraph (union),
the words that appear only in paragraph 1 (difference P1 − P2), and
the words that appear only in paragraph 2 (difference P2 − P1).
Shows the symmetric difference (words that appear in exactly one paragraph, not both).
Lets the user enter a word to see whether it exists in each paragraph set.
Constraints / Hints
Use std::transform to lowercase every word.
Use std::set_union, std::set_intersection, std::set_difference, and std::set_symmetric_difference from <algorithm>.
Keep everything in sorted order (an automatic property of std::set).
