Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes  and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.
Sequence Containers:  implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
vector
list
deque
arrays
forward_list( Introduced in C++11)
Container Adaptors :  provide a different interface for sequential containers.
queue
priority_queue
stack
Associative Containers :  implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
set
multiset
map
multimap
