Smart Pointers (Header: <memory>)
std::unique_ptr<T>
Owns and manages a single object.
Cannot be copied, only moved.
#include <memory>
std::unique_ptr<int> p = std::make_unique<int>(42);
std::shared_ptr<T>
Reference-counted ownership.
Memory is deleted when the last shared_ptr goes out of scope.
#include <memory>
std::shared_ptr<int> p1 = std::make_shared<int>(100);
std::shared_ptr<int> p2 = p1; // Shared ownership
std::weak_ptr<T>
Used with shared_ptr to avoid cyclic references.
Does not contribute to reference count.
Benefits of Smart Pointers:
Automatic cleanup (RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
No need for delete.
Avoid memory leaks.
Improved exception safety.
