1. Introduction to C++11 and Beyond
Evolution of C++: from C++98 to C++20
Modern syntax and language improvements
Smart pointers, auto, nullptr, range-based for, enum class
Lambda expressions and move semantics
Rationale behind changes and their real-world impact
2. Dynamic Memory Management
Heap vs Stack allocation
Manual memory management pitfalls
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
Smart pointers (std::uniqueptr, std::sharedptr, std::weak_ptr)
Custom deleters and ownership semantics
3. STL Associative Containers & Algorithms
Overview of STL architecture
Associative containers: map, unorderedmap, set, multimap, unorderedset
Iterators, predicates, function objects
Using std::algorithm: find_if, sort, transform, accumulate, etc.
Performance trade-offs and container selection guidelines
4. Design Patterns and Best Practices
Core OO patterns in C++: Strategy, Observer, Factory, Singleton, Visitor
SOLID principles applied in modern C++
Dependency injection, policy-based design, interface segregation
Avoiding anti-patterns in C++
Industry Best Practices: Writing clean and maintainable code, adhering to coding standards.
Exception Handling: Best practices for using exceptions and error handling in C++.
5. Concurrency and Parallelism
Thread management with std::thread
Mutexes, condition variables, locks (std::mutex, std::lockguard, std::uniquelock)
Thread-safe data sharing
Task-based concurrency: std::async, std::future, std::promise
6. Templates and Metaprogramming
Template basics: function, class, and variadic templates
SFINAE, decltype, auto, and type traits - Substitution Failure Is Not An Error
constexpr and compile-time computation
Modern alternatives: Concepts, type deduction
7. Optimizing Code Performance
Identifying performance bottlenecks
Value vs reference semantics, copy elision, move semantics
Inlining, loop unrolling, memory alignment
Cache-awareness and memory access patterns
Compiler optimization flags and profiling
8. Advanced Language Features
Rvalue references and move semantics in depth
decltype, noexcept, override, final, explicit
Lambda captures and closures
Coroutines
Modules
Structured bindings and deconstruction
9. Linking and Binary Structure
Lib vs DLL: Differences and use-cases
Compiling/Loading/Linking Static Libraries (LIB)
Compiling/Loading/Linking Dynamic Libraries (DLL)
Best practices for cross-platform binary compatibility
